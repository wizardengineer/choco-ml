# ChocoML Compiler 

## An Educational ML 

Current Game plan:
```py
type Record = { lang: int, name: str, };

# Implement methods for the Record
from Record def |>
    def method(s: int, i: int ) -> int = 
        s + i

# How functions will be constructed
def foofoo() -> list =
    let value = Record {lang: 12, name: "juju"}
    let x =
        if
    # Comment
    match i with 
        | 1 -> something()
        | 2 -> value
        | 2 -> 100
        | _ -> 0 

    # how arrays would most likely look like
    [1,2,3,4]
```

More fun...Under heavy construction ðŸš§
